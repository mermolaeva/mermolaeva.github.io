I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Linguistics](http://linguistics.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/). In 2015, I graduated from [Lomonosov Moscow State University](http://www.msu.ru/en/) with a Specialist degree (â‰ˆB.A.+M.A.) in linguistics.

My primary area of interest is computational linguistics. Some of my current projects include [implementing agreement in Minimalist Grammars]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects#mgs-with-agreement) and [formalizing Distributed Morphology]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects#formalizing-DM). Believing that insights from theoretical linguistics can and should inform practical applications, I enjoy implementing my research in [runnable code]({{ site.baseurl }}/demos).

During my undergraduate career, I have participated in a number of linguistic expeditions, acquiring fieldwork experience in Uralic and Altaic languages. Since then, I became interested in developing tools that facilitate fieldwork and aid in the processing of field data -- for instance, a system for [automated extraction of agglutinative morphology]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects#automated-processing-of-agglutinative-morphology) from small samples of glossed text.
