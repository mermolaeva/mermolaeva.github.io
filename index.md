I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Chicago. In 2015, I graduated from Lomonosov Moscow State University with a Specialist degree (â‰ˆB.A.+M.A.) in Linguistics.

My primary area of interest is computational linguistics. Believing that insights from theoretical linguistics can and should inform practical applications, I also enjoy implementing my research in code. During my undergraduate career, I participated in a number of linguistic expeditions and have fieldwork experience in Uralic and Altaic languages.

## Research interests
* Computational linguistics
* Morphology, syntax, and their interface
* Natural language processing
* Turkic languages
