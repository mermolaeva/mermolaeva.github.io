<!-- I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Linguistics](http://linguistics.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/). In 2015, I graduated from [Lomonosov Moscow State University](http://www.msu.ru/en/) with a Specialist degree (≈B.A.+M.A.) in linguistics. -->

At the present time, I hold the position of Chief Development Engineer at [Sber's SberDevices](https://sberdevices.ru/), as well as that of Junior Researcher at [Lomonosov Moscow State University](http://www.msu.ru/en/).

I received my Ph.D. in 2021 from the [Department of Linguistics](http://linguistics.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/). My dissertation, titled _Learning Syntax via Decomposition_, can be found [here](https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/3015). In 2015, I graduated from Lomonosov Moscow State University with a Specialist degree (≈B.A.+M.A.) in linguistics. 

My primary area of interest is computational linguistics. Some of my current projects include [automated optimization of minimalist grammars]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects#minimalist-grammar-optimization) and [formalizing Distributed Morphology]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects#formalizing-distributed-morphology). Believing that insights from theoretical linguistics can and should inform practical applications, I enjoy implementing my research in [runnable code]({{ site.baseurl }}/demos).

During my undergraduate career, I participated in a number of linguistic expeditions, acquiring fieldwork experience in Uralic and Altaic languages. Since then, I have been interested in developing tools that facilitate fieldwork and aid in the processing of field data -- for instance, a system for [automated extraction of agglutinative morphology]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects#automated-processing-of-agglutinative-morphology) from small samples of glossed text.
